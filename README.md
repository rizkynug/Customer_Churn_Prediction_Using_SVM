# Customer_Churn_Prediction_Using_SVM

## 📌 Project Description
This project aims to analyze customer data using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a customer will churn based on various features, such as age, balance, tenure, and other factors. The project includes stages such as data preprocessing, data cleaning, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and applying the **SVM model** for classification.

## 🎯 Goals
- To predict customer churn using the SVM model.
- To improve churn prediction accuracy through proper data preprocessing and feature selection.
- To provide insights that can help the company take preventive actions for high-risk customers to avoid churn.

## 📊 Business Impact
By reducing customer churn, companies can increase long-term revenue and decrease the costs associated with acquiring new customers. Churn modeling with SVM provides companies with a tool to make better-informed decisions and refine their customer retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Used for data processing and model application.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and analysis results.
- **Scikit-learn** : For applying the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and evaluating model performance (such as confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC AUC score).
